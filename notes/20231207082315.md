I want to revert back the commit that I have experimentally test the code into staging, but it not successfully work.

This is the commit that I want to revert back.

    fix: issue with whenever Ruby 3.2 and arrow up in console

    References:
    1. https://github.com/javan/whenever/pull/830
    2. https://github.com/javan/whenever/issues/831
```

This is the Git command that I use to revert. [^1]

```terminal
$ git revert fffa9f76f70db8c5051f564feded022ffc1208c4
```

After run above command, I get the new commit message with prefix `Revert "...."` on top of the last commit.
