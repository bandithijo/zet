## Agenda

* About osc
* The most important changes in osc 1.0
* Tips & Tricks
* Our plans for upcoming version of osc

## Abot osc

* osc (openSUSE Commander), is a command-line client for Open Build Service
* It is extensible with command-line plugins
* It is also a python library

## Changes is osc 1.0

### Changes is Pyhon support

* Python 2 support was dropped
* Only Pthon 3.6 and newer are supported
* If you're stuck with an old Python, check the **0.x-maint** branch

### Code cleanup

* The code has been modernized
* It follows `PEP-8` more than ever before
* All pylit errors were fixed

### Testing

* Tests run on all pull-requests
  * Unit tests
  * Sanity tests (coding style)
  * Buiilt tests (setup.cfg and spec changes)
  * Behave tests that use a pre-built OBS container and do not mock any osc parts!

### SSH Authentication

* osc supports SSH authentication now
* Requires enabling the auth on server
* TODO: Automatically detect the correct key and remember it for the consequent osc runs

### HTTPS connection improvements

* osc uses urllib3 for handling connections:
  * Connection pools (`osc checkout` is faster)
  * Better proxy support
* M2Crypto was replaced with cryptography

### Command-line improvements

* Replaced unmaintained cmdln.py with a custom code that raps argparse
* Support for new class-based `commands`

## Tips & Tricks

### Sources of an installed package

* `rps -q --qf "%{DISTURL}\n" bash obs://build.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Factory/standard/a69d67a42754b16cf813d5870d3a7ce-bash`
* `osc checkout <DISTURL>`

### Too many declined requests

* Does `osc request list` show too many declined requests?
* They require an action: \
  revoke or supersede them!

### The magical dot

* The `.` (dot) character is a wildcard for the project or package from the current working copy depending on the argument position, for example:
  * `osc lock .`
  * `osc lock ./.`

### Debugging failed builds

* `osc build --shell-after-fail`
* or modify oscrc: `build-shell-after-fail=1`

### Set version and download sources

* Write a `_service` file: \
  ```xml
  <services>
    <service name="download_files" mode="manual"/>
    <service name="set_version" mode="manual"/>
  </services>
  ```
* Edit `Version:` in the spec file
* Run `osc service manualrun`
* Add/remove tarballs as needed

## What's next?

### Changes in packaging

* Build osc for all %pythons
* Support Python virtual envs
* Split osc into several subpackages

### Config parser

* We don't want to maintain yet another custom config parser
* Replace with an INI parser library?
* Migrate to TOML?
* Something that preserves comments

### Argcomplete

* The current completion is hand-crafted
* We'd like to use argcomplete instead
  * Requires argument sanitization
  * "project package" vs "project/package"

### Working with XML

* XML should not be part of osc public API
* Osc contributors shouldn't touch XML unless they really have to
* How about to generate classes wrapping XML from the OBS RelaxNG schemas?

### Working with XML -- existing code

```
m = b''.join(show_package_meta(apiurl, project, package))
root = ET.fromstring(m)
root.find('title').text = ...
root.find('description').text = ...
url = root.find('url')
if url is None:
  url = ET.SubElement(root, 'url')
url.text = ...
```

### Working with XML -- the future

```
pkg = Package.from_api(apiurl, project, package)
pkg.title = ...
pkg.description = ...
pkg.url = ...
```

### Workign with XPath

* Building XPath queries is prone to errors
  * Concatenating strings
  * Dealing with inner/outer parentheses
* Wouldn't generating XPaths from function arguments be more readable?

### XPath -- the current approach

```
GET /search/project?match=
(
  contains(@name, 'openSUSE')
  or contains(@name, 'SUSE')
)
and person[@userid='Admin']
and person[@role='bugowner']
```

### XPath -- the future

```
Project.search(
  apiurl,
  name__contains=["openSUSE", "SUSE"],
  person__userid="Admin",
  person__role="bugowner"
)
```

## We need your help

* Don't duplicate osc code, contribute
* File issues on GitHub
* Write behave tests
* Let us know about your project's tests so we can run them on `osc pull-requests`
