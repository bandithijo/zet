# 20240906020031 Rake: Bash Completion for Rake (The Ruby Make)

#Ruby #Rake

## Introduction about Rake

Besides being a Linux user who is familiar with Makefile when working with C source code, I sometimes create Makefile for any kind of project.

[[20231205133103-arduino-uno-set-readwrite-permission-for-devttyacm0]]

The Ruby on Rails project is no exception.

But instead of using Makefile inside Ruby project, Ruby has own Make-like file, Rake. [^1]

> Rake is Make-like program implemented in Ruby.

Rake has following features: [^1]

1. Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
1. Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
1. Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
1. Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.
1. Supports parallel execution of tasks.

With those features, I prefer using Rake in Ruby project like Ruby on Rails project.


## Preview

```
$ rake st<Tab>
$ rake stats

$ rake test<Tab><Tab>
test              test:integration  test:recent       
test:benchmark    test:plugins      test:uncommitted  
test:functionals  test:profile      test:units
```


## Problem

Rake doesn't come with autocompletion on Bash like Makefile does. So, I need to implement the Bash completion manually for Rake.

Luckly, there is another person had built that Rake completion for Bash. [^2]

## Install

1. Must install `bash-completion` on system.
   ```
   $ sudo pacman -S bash-completion
   ```
1. Go to `/etc/bash_completion.d/` dir.
1. Downlad rake completion from the repo, using `curl` or `wget`. \
   Curl
   ```
   $ curl -o /etc/bash_completion.d/rake https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai/rake-completion/master/rake
   ```
   Wget
   ```
   $ wget -O /etc/bash_completion.d/rake https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ai/rake-completion/master/rake
   ```
1. Done


This is the rake completion file from those repo.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Bash completion support for Rake, Ruby Make.

# This messes up COMP_WORDBREAKS throughout the system.
# Fixing it to restrict changes to rakecomplete only.
# export COMP_WORDBREAKS=${COMP_WORDBREAKS/\:/}

_rakecomplete() {
    local cur
    _get_comp_words_by_ref -n : cur
    rakefile=""
    seek_path="."
    while true; do
        rakefile="${seek_path}/Rakefile"
        [[ $(readlink -f $seek_path) == "/" || -f "$rakefile" ]] && break
        seek_path="../${seek_path}"
    done

    if [[ -f "$rakefile" ]]; then
        recent=`ls -t $seek_path/.rake_tasks~ ${rakefile} **/*.rake 2> /dev/null | head -n 1`
        if [[ $recent != "$seek_path/.rake_tasks~" ]]; then
            rake --silent --prereqs | grep "rake" | cut -d " " -f 2 > $seek_path/.rake_tasks~
        fi
        COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W "`cat $seek_path/.rake_tasks~`" -- "$cur"))
        # remove colon containing prefix from COMPREPLY items
        __ltrim_colon_completions "$cur"
        return 0
    else
      COMPREPLY=()
    fi
}

complete -o default -o nospace -F _rakecomplete rake
```
