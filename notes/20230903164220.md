# 20230903164220 Jekyll: Define Page Properties without Front Matter

#Jekyll

I have pages that are generated from the generator script, namely [dex](/dex/)
and [ref](/ref/). Those pages have no front matter inside them.

How can I achieve that? Jekyll have default global configuration on
`_config.yml`. [^1] This approach is actually to carry out the "Don't Repeat
Yourself" (DRY) philosophy.

I use it to define the front matter configuration for the page. Because, I
don't want to put front matter inside page that I generated automatically.

```yaml
# filename: _config.yml

defaults:
  - scope:
      path: 'pages/dex.md'
      type: 'pages'
    values:
      permalink: '/dex/'
      title: 'dex'
  - scope:
      path: 'pages/ref.md'
      type: 'pages'
    values:
      permalink: '/ref/'
      title: 'ref'
```

I was define some front matter, such as:

1. `- scope`, for define page scoping
1. `scope:path`, path of page, where I save the page location, whiches commonly
   store on `pages/` directory
1. `scope:type`, type of page, commonly the value is `pages`
1. `values:permalink`, variable that you able to define custom URL endpoint
   like
1. `values:title`, page name that will used by title section in metatags

Other front matter variable that able to defined, can be check in the
documentation. [^1]

The result will be like this,

```
# pages/dex.md

## browser url
https://bandithijo.dev/dex/

## metatags
<head>
    <title>dex</title>
</head>
```

That's it!
