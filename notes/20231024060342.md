# 20231024060342 Firefox: Disable Middle Mouse Paste

#Firefox

There is strange behavior on Firefox, even though we have disabled "middle click paste" on GNOME via GNOME Tweaks, but "middle click paste" still normally functions on Firefox.

From what I see, Firefox has its own "middle click paste" rules configuration, named "middle mouse paste". So, we need to disable it. [^1]

1. Go to `about:config` from address bar
1. Search `middlemouse.paste` preference name
1. Change the value into `false`
