# 20240325171326 Linux: Set CLIPBOARD based on XDG_SESSION_TYPE (Xorg or Wayland)

#Clipboard #Neovim

On transition time between Window Manager that using Xorg into Wayland, I often switch back and forth between them. There are some element that maybe getting problem because of that. One of them is the CLIPBOARD.

Clipboard utilities between them are difference. On Xorg I use `xclip`, and on Wayland, I use `wl-copy` (wl-clipboard). But, the problem come from Neovim that read `wl-copy` when I am using Neovim on Xorg.

For handle this problem is easy. Of course, I should make a control flow for CLIPBOARD value on Environment.

Because Neovim is a Terminal utilities, I make control flow on `~/.profile`.

```bash
# ~/.profile

# Check if running under Xorg or Wayland
if [[ "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE" == "x11" ]]; then
    CLIP_TOOL="xclip"
elif [[ "$XDG_SESSION_TYPE" == "wayland" ]]; then
    CLIP_TOOL="wl-copy"
else
    echo "Unknown display server." >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Set up clipboard tool
export CLIPBOARD="$CLIP_TOOL"
```

Done!
