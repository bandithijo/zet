# 20231126110450 Git: Rename Last Commit Message

#Git

I accidentally make a wrong last commit message. I want to rename it.

```termial
$ git commit --amend
```

Git will open editor with latest commit message. And I able to change those commit message, and save it. The last commit message and commit hash will changed.

Or, using the shorthand one liner like this, [^1]

```terminal
$ git commit --amend -m 'new commit message'
```

> NOTE: Make sure, before change the commit message, file modification should to add into staging area.
