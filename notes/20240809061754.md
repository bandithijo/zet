# 20240809061754 VirtualBox: Up the vboxnet0 Interface

#VirtualBox

When installed Oracle VirtuaBox under Arch Linux, usually the `vboxnet0` interface is on DOWN state.

We need to set `vboxnet0` interface to UP before we can use **Host-only** Network Adapter.

```terminal
$ sudo ip link set vboxnet0 up
```

Add IP network range that you have setup on VirtualBox for `vboxnet0` interface.

I have configuration Host-only Adapter for manually like below,

```
IPv4 Address: 10.10.10.1
IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
```

So, I have `10.10.10.1/24`.

```terminal
$ sudo ip addr add 10.10.10.1/24 dev vboxnet0
```

Done.

Now we can ping into our instance IP address and access using SSH.

```
