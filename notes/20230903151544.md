# 20230903151544 Zettelkasten: Apa itu?

#NoteTaking

Ada banyak sekali literatur yang membahas tentang Zettelkasten Method. Namun saya mengambil penjelasan dari Darin Suthapong (2022), lewat video yang ia unggah di kanal Youtube nya. [^1]

Alasan saya memilih penjelasan dari Darin karena, ia sudah menggunakan metode ini selama 1 tahun dan memperbaharui penjelasan di videonya, tentang metode ini berdasarkan pengalaman yang ia dapatkan.

## What is Zettelkasten?

Zettelkasten is a method for personal knowledge management. It is designed to help you effectively learn and develop ideas by focusing on writing and thinking critically. It is invented by **Nicholas Luhmann** a German Scholar who has published more than 60 books and 600 articles during his lifetime and even more after he died.

With this much productivity you would thought that he worked really hard or had so much real power. But actually, he famously said, "I only do what is easy. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside, and do something else."

In other words, not only he was super productive and produced high quality work, but he also had a pretty good time during so as well.

> I only do what is easy. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside, and do something else. \
> -- Nicholas Luhmann

## How it works?

Zettelkasten System:

1. **Components**, which are different kinds of notes that Luhmann took
1. **Organization**, how Luhmann organizes notes
1. **Process**, how Luhmann work with his Zettelkasten

### Components

Zettel + Kasten. Kasten is Wooden Box, and Zettel is Card or Note. Wooden Box of Cards.

So, the system basically consists of index cards stored in wooden boxes.

There are 4 types of notes in the Zettelkasten System:

1. **Literature Notes**
1. **Permanent Notes**
1. **Hub Notes**
1. **Fleeting Notes**

#### Literature Notes

Just like most of us, Luhmann took a notes about what he read, but instead of taking notes on the margin of a page or in the separate notebook, he took brief notes on an index card. These notes are simply his reaction to the material he read or anything he didn't want to forget. In addition to this note, on the other side of the card, he put down bibliographical information as references.

#### Permanent Notes

Which is the most important component of the Zettelkasten. Unlike Literatur notes, which are about the reading material, Permanent notes are the ideas and insights distilled from reviewing Literature notes.

There are a couple of features of a Permanent Note:

1. Each note has a specific uniq ID, which can be referred to by other notes
1. While these notes are very sparse and condensed, they are written with great care and in Luhmann's own words
1. They are extensively linked to other notes in the Slip-box.

> [Luhmann] usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the Slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, ...in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. \
> -- SÃ¶nke Ahrens

Literature notes and Permanent notes are the core components of Zettelkasten System. But there are two more kinds of notes.

#### Hub Notes

Hub notes are zettel that don't contain any notes but instead has a list of topics/sub-topics or keywords that link to a couple of Permanent notes.

It is important to note that Hub notes don't list all the Permanent notes related to a topic or keyword, but just a couple of them to act as an entry point into the Zettelkasten.

> Hub notes are notes that contain topics and keywords that act as entry point. It can be link to a couple of Permanent notes (or not). It not list all of related topic or keyword in Permanent notes.

#### Fleeting Notes

Fleeting notes are notes that record anything that popped into Luhmann's mind during the day and are meant to be transferred to other kinds of notes later on. These notes are meant to be "fleeting" as the name suggests, and turned away pretty quickly.

### Organization

There are two Kasten or Slip-boxes:

1. **Reference**, for storing Literature notes. This is for referencing
1. **Main**, for storing Permanent notes. This is where Luhmann develop insights and ideas

#### Main Slip-box

Even though Luhmann has Hub notes which contain topics and keywords, he did not use this way to organize his notes. These are just meant to be the entry points into his Zettelkasten.

The way Luhmann organized his note instead is by sorting and linking the notes in very intentional and meaningful ways. Luhmann put related notes physically close together in a Slip-box. For example, when he created a new Permanent note, he would put this behind the note that this note is most related to and add ID to this new note.

By continuously doing this, he created different lines of thinking in his Slip-box. And if new note fit into the middle of an existing line of thinking, he would then add alternating number and letters to infinitely branch out his thinking. In addition to sorting notes, each Permanent notes also links to other notes in different locations in the Zettelkasten to traverse from one line of thinking to the other one.

What you've learned so far is the system of Zettelkasten ifself. But, actually the real power doesn't come from the system but from the activities around it. So, we will take a look at Luhmann's daily routine to understand how he worked with his Zettelkasten.

His process can be summarized, simply as:

1. **Read**
1. **Write**
1. **Review**
1. **Relate**
1. **Create**

As a Scholar, Luhmann normally begin his day by reading. Luhmann read a lot and also widely. There a more than 16.000 publication that were referred to in his Zettelkasten.

During the day, he would write down Literature note to capture things that he didn't want to forget. And wrote the notes with an eye towards existing lines of thingking in his Zettelkasten.

At the end of each day, he would review these notes and write Permanent notes which are the destillation his Literature notes and store them in appropiate location.

In addition to this routine, Luhmann also regularly review notes to either answer a question he had, or understand more about what he learned.

From this process, he may get new ideas and create a new zettel, or need to read more then go into the loop of writing Literature notes and then Permanent notes.

By continuously doing this everyday, he accumulated a wealth of knowledge and wisdom in many different areas.

## Why it works?

Now, we understand what Zettelkasten is and how it works. The next is, why this is one of the most genius inventions that could help you learn and develop ideas very effectively.

1. **Standarized format**
1. **Write to think**
1. **Friendly to your brain**
1. **High-quality encoding**

### Standarized format

Unlike the traditional note taking where you take notes in different forms and different formats, Zettelkasten streamlines everything around note-taking. So, that we can use that time to what really matters, wishes to think clearly about something.

### Write to think

Zettelkasten helps you think better by focusing on writing. Writing is one of the best feedback mechanism. When you write a Permanent note, it has to be concise and be able to stand on its own over time. So, this is one of the best way to test yourself whether you understand something or not. This property of Zettelkasten is very similar to Feynmann Technique. [^2]

### Friendly to your brain

Zettelkasten is very similar to how your brin works. Your brain learns something by relating the new information to the existing information that you already know. And that's the core property of Zettelkasten.

### High-quality encoding

Zettelkasten helps you process information effectively. As Doctor Song [^3] said about how to effectively encode the information into your memory, there are two ways: 1. Process information at a high cognitive level. 2. To relate that information to the bigger picture and to other information that you have already known. And Zettelkasten helps you both constantly and that could be why it works really really well.

## Getting Started?

Now, that you know how awesome Zettelkasten is, let's take some steps to get started.

First, you have to decide, whether you want to build a physical or digital Zettelkasten. If you want to go on a classic route, all you need is a pen, index cards, and slip-boxes. But if you want to go digital, you have to choose an app.

Second, you need to fill in your Zettelkasten with something. There are 3 approaches:

1. Summarize the books and articles that you've read
1. Transfer all the information from your existing notes app whether it is Evernote, Bear, Notion, etc. You just have to transform existing notes into Zettelkasten formats
1. Come up with your favorite problems. The favorite problems are the things that you are working on or the things that you are interested in at the moment and you would have some motivation to read more about those topics to make some Literature notes and add more content to your Zettelkasten

Finally, you have to embed Zettelkasten process into your own daily routine. You have to schedule some time to make notes and review notes, to make sure that it becomes a habit.
