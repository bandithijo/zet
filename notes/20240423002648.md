# 20240423002648 Makefile: for Arduino

#arduino #makefile

I want to make Makefile for compile and upload the arduino sketch into the board without hassle (seamlessly).

```makefile
# Compile and upload sketch file into Arduino board without hassle

# Change the value of FQBN= and PORT= from `$ arduino-cli board list`
FQBN=arduino:avr:uno
PORT=/dev/ttyACM0

*:
	arduino-cli compile -b $(FQBN) -v

upload:
	arduino-cli upload -b $(FQBN) -p $(PORT) -v

.PHONY: * upload
```
