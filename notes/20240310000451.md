# 20240310000451 Jupyter: on Rails Project

#Rails #Jupyter

Sometimes I need to build the query object before writing it into the code on Rails Console.

But after digging deep into queries, I became overwhelmed and lost. Developer experience inside Rails Console is very painful when dealing with numerous modification queries.

I need to document the entire query process thoroughly.

After watching Pak Setia Budi (YouTube: Indonesia Belajar) use Jupyter Notebook to describe the Python library, my light bulb lit up!

How can I use Jupyter Notebook on Rails Project?

On Arch Linux, install package,

```terminal
$ sudo pacman -S jupyter-notebook
```

It will install the `jupyterlab` package as well.


Go to your Rails Project, and add into your Gemfile under the `:development` group.

```ruby
# Gemfile

group :development do
  gem 'jupyter_on_rails', '~> 0.13.0'
  gem 'cztop', '~> 1.2', '>= 1.2.4'
end
```

Install it,

```terminal
$ bundle install
```

I need to provide  `libczmq` in my system, so I need to install it on my Arch Linux. There is package `czmq` on AUR.

```terminal
$ yay czmq
```

After all those steps, I have extra tasks on rake command,

```terminal
$ bundle exec rake -T
```

```
rake jupyter:install_kernels            # Install the kernel
rake jupyter:lab                        # start jupyter lab
rake jupyter:notebook                   # start jupyter notebook
```

Run jupyter notebook with `rake jupyter:notebook`, it will automatically open the web browser.
