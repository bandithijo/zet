# 20240918025315 Ruby: .blank? Like Rails

#ruby

Rails have `.blank?` to handle nil, empty, present of the Object and String.

We able to add new method into class Object and String.

```ruby
class Object
  def blank?
    respond_to?(:empty?) ? empty? : !self
  end
end

class String
  def blank?
    strip.empty?
  end
end
```
