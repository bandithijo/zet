# 20250404183040 Arch Linux: Failed to Synchronize All Databases (unable to lock database)

#ArchLinux

If you run `pacman` command and get error message,

```
:: Synchronizing package databases...
error: failed to synchronize all databases (unable to lock database)
```

Make sure there is no `pacman` process that running.

To fix those problem, we just need to remove `/var/lib/pacman/db.lck`.

```
$ sudo rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```

Done!
