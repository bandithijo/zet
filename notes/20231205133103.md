# 20231205133103 Arduino UNO: Set Read/Write Permission for /dev/ttyACM0

#arduino

When uploading sketch into Arduino, usually (on Linux) you will get rejected by read/write permission of `/dev/ttyACM0`.

So, we need to give those dev a read/write permission. [^1]

```terminal
$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
```
