# 20241016083731 Rails: Passing output in Rails console into file (JSON)

#Ruby #Rails #JSON

For example, I have response for 3rd party library as a Ruby hash in variable `response`.

```ruby
latest_stock = LatestStockPrice.new
response = latest_stock.get_price
```

I want to export those Hash value of `response` into a file. I give a name `output.json`

```ruby
File.open('output.json', 'w') do |file|
  file.write response
end
```

Do not open it yet! Because inside `output.json` it is a single line JSON. Expecially if you are using Neovim. It will blow your editor.

We need to generate the pretty JSON format with `jq` command on Terminal into a file.

```terminal
$ jq . output.json > output_formatted.json
```

Done!
