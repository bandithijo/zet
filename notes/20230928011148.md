## Current state of RPM

* File triggers and Boolean Dependencies
  * Over two years ago
* Only "small" features since
  * New debuginfo
  * Clean up, rewrite: header check, signature handling
  * With, without, unless
  * Audit, zstd, SSD concervation support

## Looking at Spec Files

* Number of packages is still growing
* Maintenance is time consuming
* Changes to many packages are hard
* Spec files should be shorter and easier
* Let's see what we can remove!

## Areas of Interest

* Scriptlets
* Automatic Build Dependencies
* Using Distgit data
* Build Templates
* Automatic / templated Sub-Packages

## Steps needed for an update

* Create patch and add to spec file
  * Pick next number
* Apply patch in %prep (use number from above)
* Increase Release number
* Add %changelog entry
  * Name, email, version, and release
* Commit to git
  * Copy changelog entry to git message

## Using Distgit Data

* To be implemented outside of RPM
* Changelog from git history
* Version / Release from distgit
* Reduce merge conflicts

## Dynamic Build Dependencies

* Run %generate_buildrequires after %prep
* Breaks assumptions about builds and src.rpms
  * Will require work for build systems
* .buildrequires.nosrc.rpmn on missing dependencies
* rpmbuild -br --nodeps
* May requires multiple runs

## The Package Archipelago

* Lack of influence of the islands
  * Control either by RPM upstream of Packagers
* Extensive Packaging Guide Lines
* Establish groups of packages
  * Offer packager canned solutions
  * Make larger changes easier

## Bulid Templates

* Centralize boiler plate code
  * eclasses in ebuild
* Shared among similar packages
  * e.g. Python packages, C libraries, ...
* Opt in per package
* Different implementations per release
  * Replace `#if 0%{?disto}`

## Sub Package Templates

* Template for common sub packages
  * devel, statis, doc, language, lib, ...
* Extend syntax for normal sub packages
* Convenience vs Control
  * Less strict to match more cases
* Used in combination with (Build) templates
* Don't build if empty
* Don't error on missing files
* Steal files from (main) package
* Allow appending file list / overwriting attributes
* Create sub package per sub package
* Have rules for filtering files (debuginfo)
