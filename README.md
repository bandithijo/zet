# 🗃️ BanditHijo's Zettelkasten

Hi, I'm Rizqi Nur Assyaufi. This is my personal (modified) **Zettelkasten** 🗃️. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic I feel like writing about.

I'm using neovim with [Furkanzmc/zettelkasten.nvim](https://github.com/Furkanzmc/zettelkasten.nvim) to manage the notes.

> `zettelkasten.nvim` philosophy: embraces Vim by trying its hardest to not create new commands or mappings. Everything this plugin provides should ideally be useable with existing Vim options, mappings, and commands.

Generate the index notes with 🔖 `:ZkBrowse`

I'm using (modified) timestamp format: `%Y%m%d%H%M%S` as Uniq Identifier ID for my notes.

Inspired by [Robert S. (rwxrob)'s Zettelkasten](https://github.com/rwxrob/zet) since 2021, but I don't have time to playing with it. So, in September 2023, I decided to start my Zettelkasten journey even though it wasn't perfect at first.
