# BanditHijo's Zettelkasten

Hi, I'm Rizqi Nur Assyaufi. This is my personal 🗃️ **Zettelkasten**. It contains stuff on pretty much any topic I feel like writing about.

I'm using neovim with [Furkanzmc/zettelkasten.nvim](https://github.com/Furkanzmc/zettelkasten.nvim) plugin to handle relation between files.

> `zettelkasten.nvim` philosophy: embraces Vim by trying its hardest to not create newcommands or mappings. Everything this plugin provides should ideally be useable with existing Vim options, mappings, and commands.
